This list can be added to. Please be reasonable with your requests.
1)Be respectful of others and bee civil in all discussions. We don't want to 
create a toxic environment.
2)Avoid slang and profanity. It's fine to joke around every now and then, but do
note that we have group chats for things like that.
3)This is not a place to post solutions to homework. While all of us are likely
experienced enough in code to do the work easily, this is still a class, and we
are expected to do all the work. This repo will likely contain extra stuff anyway.
4)Try to keep everything organized.
